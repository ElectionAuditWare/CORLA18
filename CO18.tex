\begin{abstract}
Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) generally rely on random samples of ballots.
Risk calculations are simplest for random samples consisting of individual ballots drawn with replacement from all ballots cast in a contest.
However, stratified sampling-—-partitioning the population of ballots into disjoint
strata, and sampling independently from the strata——-may simplify logistics or make the audit more efficient.
For instance, Colorado intends to conduct risk-limiting audits of statewide contests and other contests that cross jurisdictional boundaries.
Some Colorado counties (comprising 98.2\% of voters)
have new voting systems that allow auditors to check how the system interpreted each ballot; the rest do not.
Before this work, the only approaches to combining information
from all counties into a single RLA either required all counties to 
use \emph{ballot-polling}, which is not as efficient as \emph{ballot-level comparison}, which only the newer systems support, or to use
variable batch size comparison audits, which would require exporting data from the older systems in a way that the counties have not yet undertaken, and weighted random sampling, which Colorado's audit software does not support.
We give a simpler approach that is substantially more efficient than using ballot polling everywhere: stratify cast ballots into two groups (ballots cast in counties with newer systems and those cast in counties with legacy system); sample from those strata independently; apply a generalization of ballot-level comparison auditing in one stratum and of ballot-polling auditing in the other to test the hypothesis that the ``overstatement error'' in each stratum exceeds some threshold; then combine the stratum-level results using Fisher's nonparametric combination of tests; maximize the combined $P$-value over all partitions of the error.
This yields a more efficient audit of contests that cross jurisdictional boundaries (including statewide contests and most federal contests) than ballot-polling would give.
The method for combining information from different audit strategies (ballot-polling and comparison) is new.
Moreover, it is more efficient than extant methods for using stratified samples with a single audit strategy
(e.g.,comparison audits in separate strata).\comment{Kellie: we need to run a test against the Higgins, Rivest \& Stark method}.
We also explain how Colorado's current audit software (RLATool) could be extended to support audits of cross-jurisdictional contests. 
%This paper addresses both gaps, along the way introducing a simple, efficient way to use stratified sampling in RLAs.
% (Stratification makes it easier to combine ballot-polling and ballot-level comparison, and also is useful to reduce coordination among jurisdictions required to audit cross-jurisdictional contests.)
We provide an open-source reference implementation of the method and exemplar calculations in Jupyter notebooks.

\section{Introduction}
A risk-limiting audit (RLA) of an election is a procedure that
has a known, pre-specified minimum chance of leading to a full manual tally of the ballots if the electoral outcome of that tally (i.e., the winning candidates or positions, not the exact vote counts) would differ from the
reported outcome. 
RLAs require a durable, voter-verifiable record of voter intent, such as paper ballots,
and they assume that this audit trail is sufficiently complete and accurate that a full hand
tally would show the true electoral outcome.
That assumption is not automatically satisfied: a \emph{compliance audit}
\cite{starkWagner12} 
is required to check whether election accounting and security procedures were followed.

Risk-limiting audits are generally (but not necessarily) incremental: they examine more ballots, or batches of ballots,
until either (i)~there is strong statistical evidence that a full hand tabulation would confirm the outcome,
or (ii)~the audit has led to a full hand tabulation, the result of which should become the official
result.

%RLAs have been piloted in California, Colorado, and Ohio, and a test of
%RLA procedures has been conducted in Arizona.
%RLA bills are being drafted or are already under consideration in California,
%Virginia, Washington, and other states.
%A number of laws have either allowed or mandated risk-limiting audits,
%including California AB~2023 (Salda\~{n}a), SB~360 (Padilla), and AB~44 (Mullin);
%Rhode Island SB~413A and HB~5704A; and Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS)~1-7-515.
%At the time of writing, California is considering another RLA bill, AB~2125.

%CRS~1-7-515 requires 
%Colorado to conduct risk-limiting audits beginning in 2017.
%(There are provisions to allow the Secretary of State to exempt some counties.)
%The first set of coordinated risk-limiting election audits across the state took place in Colorado in November, 2017.\footnote{%
% See \url{https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/RLA/2017RLABackground.html}
%}
%Those audits only covered contests restricted to a single county:
%counties could audit independently.
%To audit statewide elections and contests that cross county lines, Colorado will need to implement new approaches
%and modify RLATool\footnote{%
%  \url{https://github.com/FreeAndFair/ColoradoRLA/}
%}, 
%the open-source audit software used for their 2017 audits. 

% \comment{confirm or correct these assertions} They are not correct. PBS
%State laws mandating risk-limiting audits generally require a simple random sample of ballots from each contest to be audited.
%This is feasible when contests are contained within a single jurisdiction, where elections officials can deal with ballots locally.
%However, the logistics of drawing a simple random sample of ballots that cross jurisdiction lines are more difficult.
%This would require a central agency to determine which ballots each jurisdiction should draw, and then each jurisdiction must report the results of their audit back to the central agency to be combined.

The most efficient, transparent, and statistically tractable sampling design for risk-limiting audits is to sample individual ballots uniformly at random from the ballots cast in the contest, with or without replacement.
However, to audit contests that cross jurisdictional boundaries (\emph{cross-jurisdictional contests}) then requires top-down organization to coordinate sampling in different counties, and may require different counties to use the lowest-common denominator risk calculations. 

Thus, it may be more tractable logistically to use a stratified sample, selecting ballots independently from different counties or groups of counties. 
Stratification may also be useful within counties, for instance, to allow auditors to sample independently from ballots cast in person, by mail, and provisionally cast ballots.

While stratified RLAs have been considered previously \cite{stark08a,higginsEtal11}, the methods addressed only a single approach to auditing, batch-level comparisons, and only a particular test statistic.

This paper introduces a more general approach to using stratified samples in RLAs.
The approach involves maximizing a $P$-value over one or more nuisance parameters.
For each value of the nuisance parameters, Fisher's combining function is used to combine independent $P$-values from the strata. 
Conceptually, the procedure considers every possible partition of outcome-changing error across the strata, and calculates the largest
$P$-value across all such partitions, using Fisher's combining function.
If that maximum $P$-value is less than the risk limit, the audit can stop;
otherwise, the audit must inspect more ballots.

In practice, it is not necessary to consider all possible partitions the allowable error across strata, because the $P$-value is a simple combination of monotonic functions.
We present a numerical procedure (with a Python implementation)
to find upper bounds on the maximum $P$-value when there are two strata.
The procedure can be generalized to more than two strata.

%Colorado's ``uniform voting system'' program\footnote{%
%  \url{https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VotingSystems/UniformVotingSystem.html}
%} 
%led many Colorado counties to purchase (or to plan to purchase) voting systems
%that are auditable at the ballot level: those systems export cast vote records (CVRs)
%for individual ballots in a manner that allows the corresponding paper ballot to be identified,
%and conversely, make it possible to find the CVR corresponding to any
%particular paper ballot.
%We call counties that have such systems ``CVR'' counties.
%It is estimated that by June, 2018, 98.2\% of active Colorado voters will be in CVR counties.
%CVR counties can perform ``ballot-level comparison audits,'' \cite{lindemanStark12} 
%which are currently the
%most efficient approach to risk-limiting audits in that they require examining fewer
%ballots than other methods do, when the outcome of the contest under audit 
%is in fact correct.
%
%Voting systems in other counties (``legacy'' or ``no-CVR'' counties) 
%do not allow auditors to check how the system
%interpreted voter intent for individual ballots.
%Election results involving those counties can still be audited, provided the voting systems
%create a voter-verifiable paper trail (e.g., voter-marked paper ballots) that is
%conserved to ensure that it remains accurate and intact, and organized well enough
%to permit ballots to be selected at random.
%Pilot audits in California \cite{CA_SOS_EAC} suggest it is more efficient to audit such systems
%using``ballot-polling'' \cite{lindemanEtal12,lindemanStark12} than using ``batch-level comparisons.''

Voting systems that export cast vote records (CVRs) are auditable at the ballot level: 
those systems record votes in a manner that allows the corresponding paper ballot to be identified,
and conversely, make it possible to find the CVR corresponding to any
particular paper ballot.
We call counties that have such systems ``CVR'' counties.
%It is estimated that by June, 2018, 98.2\% of active Colorado voters will be in CVR counties.
CVR counties can perform ``ballot-level comparison audits,'' \cite{lindemanStark12} 
which are currently the most efficient approach to risk-limiting audits in that they require examining fewer
ballots than other methods do, when the outcome of the contest under audit 
is in fact correct.
Ballot-level comparison audits involve comparing a human reading of individual ballots to the machine-constructed CVRs for the same ballots.


Voting systems in other counties (``legacy'' or ``no-CVR'' counties) 
do not allow auditors to check how the system interpreted voter intent for individual ballots.
Election results involving those counties can still be audited, provided the voting systems
create a voter-verifiable paper trail (e.g., voter-marked paper ballots) that is
conserved to ensure that it remains accurate and intact, and organized well enough
to permit ballots to be selected at random.
``Ballot-polling'' audits \cite{lindemanEtal12,lindemanStark12} can be used to test whether the vote proportions 
found by hand-counting a simple random sample of ballots differ significantly enough from what was reported
to change the election outcome. 
Ballot-polling audits require examining more ballots than comparison audits.

There is currently no literature on how to combine
ballot polling and ballot-level comparisons in a single risk-limiting audit.
Existing methods either would require all counties to use the lowest
common denominator (ballot-polling, which does not take advantage of the CVRs,
and thus is expected to require more auditing than a method that uses the available CVRs),
 or would require no-CVR counties to perform batch-level comparisons, which were found in
California to be less efficient than ballot-polling audits\cite{CA_SOS_EAC}.%
\footnote{%
  See~\cite{Rivest-2018-bayesian-tabulation-audits}
  for a different (Bayesian) approach to auditing contests that include both CVR counties
  and no-CVR counties. In general, Bayesian audits are not risk-limiting.
}

We use our new approach to stratification to show
how contests that cross jurisdictional boundaries (cross-jurisdictional contests, such as gubernatorial contests, statewide ballot measures, and
many federal contests) can be audited efficiently when some of the jurisdictions an perform ballot-level comparison audits
and the others can only perform ballot-polling audits.
This has an immediate application in Colorado, where state laws require
risk-limiting audits.
For its first mandatory audits, in November 2017, contests were contained entirely within counties.
Statewide contests pose a problem:
not every county has voting technology that can export CVRs.
Our proposed stratified ``hybrid'' audit could dramatically reduce the number of ballots inspected
compared to cruder auditing strategies to handle heterogeneous voting equipment.

Section~\ref{sec:hybrid} presents the new method for stratified audits
based on combining $P$-values in different strata.
% This approach is generalizable to other stratified audits, where ballots are divided into disjoint
% ``strata,'' sampled independently; the results are combined using Fisher's method to produce an audit of the
% overall contest.
%All the approaches require new software, including some changes to RLATool.
We show hos the method allows ballot-polling auditing in one 
stratum to be combined with ballot-level comparison auditing in another.

\note{This is out of place. We should either drop the crude approaches or wrap them in something else.
We could include the variable batch size stuff for completeness, but if so, we need to explain why we think the hybrid approach is better---which is mostly that it's a smaller change to what CO is doing.}
Section~\ref{sec:crude} presents crude but inefficient approaches that could be implemented easily, while
Section~\ref{sec:variable} presents an approach based on comparison audits with different batch sizes.
This approach is statistically simple and relatively efficient, but might require changing how counties
handle their ballots.
%Section~\ref{sec:subcollections}
%describes how audit efficiency could be improved in CVR counties by combining CVR
%data with data from Colorado's voter registration system, SCORE.\footnote{%
%  SCORE is Colorado's voter registration system, which also tracks who voted.
%  See \url{https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/SCORE/SCOREhome.html}.
%  SCORE essentially keeps track of how many ballots of each style were returned by voters,
%  information that can be used to check whether the voting system tabulated the correct number
%  of ballots in each contest.
%} 
Next \note{section ref?}, we specialize the stratified audit approach to handle heterogeneous voting equipment.
Sections~\ref{sec:comparisonError} and~\ref{sec:ballotPollError} explain
the necessary modifications to ballot-level comparison and ballot-polling to construct within-stratum hypothesis tests about the amount of overstatement
error. \note{need to sketch what overstatements are here}, respectively. 
Section~\ref{sec:colorado} gives numerical examples of these approaches in simulated audits,
using Colorado as an example use case.
We provide example software implementing the risk calculations for
our recommended approach in a Python Jupyter notebook.\footnote{%

}
Section~\ref{sec:discussion} gives recommendations and
considerations for implementation.

%\subsection{Priorities for Colorado}
%\note{for this particular paper focused on stratification, is the order of paragraphs here right?}
%Auditing efficiency is controlled in part by how well the audit can limit the sample to ballots that
%contain the contests under audit.
%Some contests are on (essentially) every ballot, for instance the governor's race.
%Others, such as mayoral contests, may appear on only a small fraction of ballots cast in
%a county.
%Partisan primaries---even for statewide office---are somewhere in between,
%because in general no single party's primary appears on every ballot cast in the state.
%Thus, either we reduce efficiency for the sake of simplicity by continuing to sample ballots uniformly within 
%counties (or collections of counties), or we develop a way to
%focus the auditing on the ballots that contain the contest.
%The latter requires external information, e.g., from SCORE,
%as discussed below.
%
%Moreover, party primaries for statewide offices (and perhaps other contests) will
%include CVR counties and no-CVR counties, so we need a method to audit
%across both kinds of voting technology. 
%
%This report addresses both issues, providing options for effectively auditing heterogeneous 
%voting technology, varying in efficiency, complexity, and on whom any additional audit burden falls.

%\section{Preliminary notation}
%Here and generally throughout the paper, we 
%discuss auditing a single plurality contest at a time, although the same sample can be used to audit
%more than one contest (and super-majority contests), and there are ways of combining audits of different contests into
%a single process \cite{stark09c,stark10d}.
%We use terminology drawn from a number of papers; the key reference is Lindeman and Stark, 2012~\cite{lindemanStark12}.
%An \emph{overstatement error} is an error that caused the margin between \emph{any} reported
%winner and \emph{any} reported loser to appear larger than it really was.
%An \emph{understatement error} is an error that caused the margin between \emph{every} reported
%winner and \emph{every} reported loser to appear to be smaller than it really was.
%
%Throughout, we will refer to a contest between reported winner $w$ and reported loser $\ell$.
%The total number of reported votes for candidate~$w$ is denoted $V_w$ 
%and the total for candidate~$\ell$ is denoted $V_\ell$, so that $V_w > V_\ell$, since 
%$w$ is the reported winner.
%Additional notation is introduced below as the need arises.

\section{Stratified ``hybrid'' audits} \label{sec:hybrid}

\emph{Stratified sampling} involves partitioning the cast ballots
into non-overlapping groups and sampling independently from those groups.
\cite{stark08a,higginsEtal11} discuss stratified sampling in batch-level comparison audits.
\note{This is a non sequitur.} One could stratify by county, but in general it is simpler and more efficient
statistically (i.e., it requires examining fewer ballots) to minimize the number of strata.
Stratification is useful in other circumstances, too, for instance to ``decouple'' sampling
in different counties.
The method we develop here works generally to construct a RLA using stratified sampling.

Here and generally throughout the paper, we 
discuss auditing a single plurality contest at a time, although the same sample can be used to audit
more than one contest (and super-majority contests), and there are ways of combining audits of different contests into
a single process \cite{stark09c,stark10d}.
We use terminology drawn from a number of papers; the key reference is Lindeman and Stark, 2012~\cite{lindemanStark12}.
An \emph{overstatement error} is an error that caused the margin between \emph{any} reported
winner and \emph{any} reported loser to appear larger than it really was.
An \emph{understatement error} is an error that caused the margin between \emph{every} reported
winner and \emph{every} reported loser to appear to be smaller than it really was.

Throughout, we will refer to a contest between reported winner $w$ and reported loser $\ell$.
The total number of reported votes for candidate~$w$ is denoted $V_w$ 
and the total for candidate~$\ell$ is denoted $V_\ell$, so that $V_w > V_\ell$, since 
$w$ is the reported winner.

Let $V_{w\ell} > 0$ denote the contest-wide margin (in votes) of reported winner 
$w$ over reported loser $\ell$.
Suppose that we have two strata indexed, $s=1, 2.$
Let $V_{w\ell,s}$ denote the margin (in votes) of reported winner $w$ over reported loser $\ell$
in stratum $s$. 
Note that $V_{w\ell,s}$ could be negative in one stratum.
Let $A_{w\ell}$ denote the margin (in votes)
of reported winner $w$ over reported loser $\ell$ that 
a full hand count of the entire contest would show, that is, the \emph{actual} margin rather
than the \emph{reported} margin.
Reported winner $w$ really beat reported loser $\ell$ if and only if $A_{w\ell} > 0$.
Define $A_{w\ell,s}$ to be the actual margin (in votes) of $w$ over $\ell$ in stratum $s$;
this too may be negative.

Let $\omega_{w\ell,s} \equiv V_{w\ell,s} - A_{w\ell,s}$ be the \emph{overstatement}
of the margin of $w$ over $\ell$ in stratum $s$.
Reported winner $w$ really beat reported loser 
$\ell$ if and only if $\omega_{w\ell} \equiv \omega_{w\ell,1} + \omega_{w\ell,2} < V_{w\ell}$.

The null hypothesis $\omega_{w\ell, 1} + \omega_{w\ell, 2} \ge V_{w\ell}$ is true if and only if there exists \textit{some} $\lambda \in \Re$ such that 
$\omega_{w\ell, 1}\ge \lambda V_{w\ell}$ and 
$\omega_{w\ell, 2}\ge (1-\lambda) V_{w\ell}$.\footnote{%
  Set $\lambda = \frac{\omega_{w\ell, 1}}{\omega_{w\ell, 1}+\omega_{w\ell, 2}}$.
}
If, for all $\lambda$, we can reject the hypothesis that the 
overstatement error in stratum~1 is greater than or equal to $\lambda V_{w\ell}$ \emph{and} 
the overstatement error in stratum~2 is greater than or equal to $(1-\lambda) V_{w\ell}$, then
we can conclude that the outcome is correct.
(The approach generalizes to $S$ strata: if there is no tuple $( \lambda_s )_{s=1}^S$ such that
$\sum_s \lambda_s = 1$ and $\omega_s \ge \lambda_s V_{w\ell}$ for all $s$, then
the outcome is correct.)

To test the conjunction hypothesis that both stratum null hypotheses are true, we use 
Fisher's combining function.
Let $p_s(\lambda_s)$ be the $P$-value of the hypothesis $\omega_{w\ell,s} \ge \lambda_s V_{w\ell}$.
Define $\lambda_1 \equiv \lambda$ and $\lambda_2 \equiv 1-\lambda$.
If the null hypothesis that $\omega_{w\ell,1} \ge \lambda_1 V_{w\ell}$ and 
$\omega_{w\ell,2} \ge \lambda_2 V_{w\ell}$ is true, then 
\beq \label{eq:fisher}
   \chi(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = -2 \sum_{s=1}^2 \ln p_s(\lambda_s)
\eeq
has a probability distribution that is dominated by the chi-square distribution with 4~degrees
of freedom.\footnote{%
   If the two tests had continuously distributed $P$-values, the distribution would be exactly
   chi-square with 4~degrees of freedom, but if either $P$-value has atoms when
   the null hypothesis is true, it is in general stochastically smaller.
   This follows from a coupling argument along the lines of Theorem~4.12.3 in \cite{grimmett01}.
}
Fisher's combined statistic will tend to be small when both null hypotheses are true.
If either is false, then as the sample size increases, Fisher's combined statistic will tend to grow.

If, for all $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2 = 1- \lambda_1$, we can reject the conjunction
hypothesis at level $\alpha$, the audit can stop.
The stratified audit thus involves examining more randomly selected ballots from the two strata until 
either the minimum value Fisher's combined statistic over all $\lambda$ 
is larger than the $1-\alpha$ quantile of the chi-square
distribution with 4~degrees of freedom, or until both strata have been fully hand tabulated.

$p_s(\lambda)$ could be a $P$-value for the hypothesis
$\omega_{w\ell,s} \ge \lambda_s V_{w\ell}$ from any test procedure (although
if the audit is to be sequential, the tests in the two strata must be sequential tests or
some other method must be used to account for multiplicity). 
We assume, however, that $p_s$ is based on a one-sided test, and that the tests
for different values of $\lambda$ ``nest'' in the sense that if $a > b$,
then $p_s(a) > p_s(b)$.
This monotonicity is a reasonable requirement because the evidence that the overstatement
is greater than $a$ should be weaker than the evidence that the overstatement is greater than
$b$, if $a > b$.
In particular, this monotonicity holds for the tests proposed in sections~\ref{sec:comparisonError}
and \ref{sec:ballotPollError}.


\subsection{Maximizing Fisher's combined $P$-value}
The audit can stop if the maximum of Fisher's combined $P$-value over all
$\lambda$ is not larger than $\alpha$, the risk limit.
For a given set of audit data, 
finding the maximum $P$-value over all $\lambda$
is a one-dimensional optimization problem, but the objective function is not necessarily concave.
We need a computational strategy to ensure that the maximum is small
without evaluating the $P$-value for all $\lambda$.

The approach embodied in the software we provide uses a grid search, refining the
grid once the maximum has been bracketed.
This is not guaranteed to find the global maximum exactly, although it can approximate 
the maximum as closely as one desires, by refining the mesh.

A more rigorous approach is to find bounds on Fisher's combining function for all
$\lambda$. 
(Lower bounds translate directly into an upper bound on the $P$-value as a function of
$\lambda$: if the lower bound is 
everywhere larger than the $1-\alpha$ quantile of the chi-squared distribution with 4~degrees of freedom, the maximum $P$-value is no larger than $\alpha$.)
Let $\lambda_-$ be the smallest possible value of $\lambda$ and $\lambda_+$ be the largest
possible value of $\lambda$.
Some values of $\lambda$ can be ruled out \emph{a priori}, because (for instance) $\omega_{w\ell,s} \le
V_{w\ell,s}+N_s$,
where $N_s$ is the number of ballots cast in stratum $s$, and thus
\beq
   1 - \frac{V_{w\ell,2}+N_2}{V_{w\ell}} \le \lambda \le \frac{V_{w\ell,1}+N_1}{V_{w\ell}}.
\eeq
Recall that $p_s(\cdot)$ increases monotonically in its argument, so $p_1(\lambda)$ is
monotonically increasing in $\lambda$ and $p_2(1-\lambda)$ is monotonically decreasing in $\lambda$.
Suppose $[a, b) \subset [\lambda_-, \lambda_+]$.
Then for all $\lambda \in [a, b)$, $-2\ln p_1(\lambda) \ge -2\ln p_1(b)$ and
$-2\ln p_2(1-\lambda) \ge -2\ln p_2(1-a)$.
Thus
\beq
   \chi(\lambda) = -2(\ln p_1(\lambda)+ \ln p_2(1-\lambda))
          \ge -2(\ln p_1(b) + \ln p_2(1-a)) \equiv \chi_-[a,b).
\eeq
This gives a (constant) lower bound for $\chi$ on the interval $[a, b)$; the corresponding 
upper bound is $\chi(\lambda) \le -2(\ln p_1(a) + \ln p_2(1-b)) \equiv \chi_+[a,b)$.
Partitioning $[\lambda_-, \lambda_+]$ into a collection of intervals $[a_k, a_{k+1})$
and finding $\chi_-[a_k, a_{k+1})$ and $\chi_+[a_k, a_{k+1})$ for each
yields piecewise-constant lower and upper bounds for $\chi(\lambda)$; if,
 for all $\lambda \in [\lambda_-, \lambda_+]$, the lower bound
is larger than the $1-\alpha$ quantile of the chi-square distribution with 4~degrees of freedom,
the audit can stop; if the upper bound is anywhere less than the $1-\alpha$ quantile of the chi-square distribution with 4~degrees of freedom, the sample size in one or both strata needs to be larger.



\section{Combining ballot-polling and comparison audits}\label{sec:combiningMethods}

In this section, we discuss several approaches that one could take to audit contests that span
CVR counties and legacy counties.
First, we present several simple but crude ideas.
Next, we discuss how batch-level audits could improve efficiency.
Finally, we specialize the stratified audit method in Section~\ref{sec:hybrid} to this case.

\subsection{Simple approaches} \label{sec:crude}

\subsubsection{Hand count the legacy counties}
The simplest approach to combining legacy counties with CVR counties is to require every
legacy county to do a full hand count, and to conduct a 
ballot-level comparison audit in CVR counties, based on contest margins adjusted for
the results of the manual tallies in the CVR counties.
For instance, imagine a contest with two candidates, reported winner $w$ and reported loser $\ell$.
Suppose that a full manual tally of the votes in the legacy counties shows $V_w'$ votes for $w$ and
$V_\ell'$ votes for $\ell$.
Suppose that a total of $N$ ballots were cast in the CVR counties.
Then the \emph{diluted margin}  for the comparison audit in the CVR counties is defined to be
$[(V_w-V_w')-(V_\ell-V_\ell')]/N$.
Requiring a full hand count in the legacy counties has obvious disadvantages,
but does not force CVR counties to do additional auditing to compensate for the legacy counties.

%\subsection{Subtract error bounds for the legacy counties from vote totals}
%If ballot accounting and data from Colorado's voter registration system, SCORE,\footnote{%
%  SCORE is Colorado's voter registration system, which also tracks who voted.
%  See \url{https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/SCORE/SCOREhome.html}.
%  SCORE essentially keeps track of how many ballots of each style were returned by voters,
%  information that can be used to check whether the voting system tabulated the correct number
%  of ballots in each contest.
%}
% can provide good upper bounds on the number of ballots cast in
%each contest in legacy counties, there are simple upper bounds on the total
%possible overstatement error each legacy county could contribute to the overall contest
%results; those can be subtracted from the overall margin (as in the previous subsection) and the
%remainder of the contests can be audited in CVR counties against the adjusted margins.
%For instance, consider a contest that appears on $N$ ballots in a legacy counties.
%Suppose that in legacy counties, the overall, statewide contest winner, $w$, is reported to have received $V_w'$ votes, and some loser, $\ell$, is reported to have received $V_\ell'$ votes. 
%(Note that $V_\ell'$ could be greater than $V_w'$: $w$ is not necessarily the reported winner in the legacy counties.)
%Then the most overstatement error that the county could possibly have in determining whether
%$w$ in fact beat $\ell$ is if every reported undervote, invalid vote, or vote for a different candidate, $t$, had 
%in fact been a vote for $\ell$ (producing a 1-vote overstatement), and every vote reported for 
%$w$ was in fact a vote for $\ell$ (producing a 2-vote overstatement).
%The reduction in the margin that would produce is 
%$N - V_w' - V_\ell' + 2V_w' = N + V_w' - V_\ell'$ votes.
%
%Whereas the previous approach places the auditing burden created by obsolescent equipment entirely on 
%the legacy counties, this approach places it entirely upon the CVR counties. In a close contest, it 
%could require a full hand count in every county.

\subsubsection{Treat legacy counties as if every ballot selected from them for audit has a two-vote overstatement}\label{sec:two-vote-over}
Another simple-but-inefficient approach is to sample uniformly from all counties as if one
were performing a ballot-level comparison audit everywhere,  but to 
treat any ballot
selected from a legacy county as a two-vote overstatement, essentially following \cite{banuelosStark12}.

\subsection{Variable batch sizes} \label{sec:variable}

Another approach is to perform a comparison audit across all counties, but to use batches consisting
of more than one ballot (and to perform batch-level comparisons)
in legacy counties and batches consisting of a single ballot (and to perform ballot-level comparisons) in CVR counties.\footnote{%
 For majority and plurality elections, including those in which voters can select more than one candidate,
  audits can be based on overstatement and understatement errors at the level of batches.
}
This requires that the no-CVR counties report vote subtotals
for physically identifiable batches.
If a county's voting system can only report subtotals by precinct but 
the county does not sort paper ballots by
precinct, this approach might require revising how the county handles its
paper.

That said, many California counties that do not sort vote-by-mail (VBM)
ballots by precinct conduct the statutory 1\% audits by manually retrieving the ballots 
for just those precincts selected for audit from whatever physical batches they happen to be in.%: 
%the situation is identical to that in Colorado.

Another tactic is the ``Boulder-style'' batch-level audit,\footnote{%
 See \url{http://bcn.boulder.co.us/~neal/elections/boulder-audit-10-11/}.
}
which requires generating 
vote subtotals after each physical batch is scanned, and exporting those subtotals in machine-readable form.
That in turn may require using extra memory cards, repeatedly initializing and deleting tabulation databases,
or other measures that add complexity and opportunity for error.

Those two approaches are labor-intensive but provide a viable short-term solution. %,
%especially combined with information from SCORE\footnote{%
% SCORE is Colorado's Statewide Voter Registration System; see
% \url{https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/SCORE/SCOREhome.html} (last visited 5 May 2018).
%}
%to check that the reported batch-level results contain the correct number of ballots for each contest under audit.
Moreover, this approach does not unduly increase the workload in CVR counties
to compensate for legacy equipment.

%Variable-batch-size comparison audits require modifying or augmenting
%RLATool in several ways: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%  \item The CVR reporting tool would need to be modified to allow no-CVR counties to
%report batch-level results in a manner analogous to how CVR counties report
%ballot-level results, or an external tool would need to be provided.
%
%  \item The sampling
%algorithm would have to allow sampling batches with unequal probability.
%Efficient batch-level audits involve sampling batches with probability proportional
%to a bound on the possible overstatement error in the batch.
%It would also need to calculate the appropriate sampling probability for each batch.
%Again, this could be accommodated using an external tool to draw the sample from legacy counties.
%
%  \item The risk calculations would need to be modified. 
%This, too, could be done with external software, with suitable provisions for capturing audit data
%from RLATool or directly from legacy counties.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%None of these changes is enormous; 
The mathematical details for calculating
batch-level error bounds, drawing the samples with probability proportional to an
error bound, and calculating the attained risk from the sample results are worked out
in published papers \cite{stark09c,stark09b,stark10d}.
Indeed, this is the method that was used in several of California's pilot audits,
including the audit in Orange County.
Section~\ref{sec:comparisonError} derives a method for comparison audits with variable batch sizes.

\subsection{Stratified hybrid audit}
The stratified audit approach from Section~\ref{sec:hybrid} can solve the problem of auditing in CVR and no-CVR counties.
We use two strata: one comprising the ballots cast in CVR counties and the other comprising the ballots cast in
no-CVR counties. 
Every ballot cast in the contest is in exactly one of the two strata. 

Calculating $p_s(\cdot)$ for Equation~\ref{eq:fisher} is described in
sections~\ref{sec:comparisonError} and~\ref{sec:ballotPollError} for the CVR and no-CVR strata,
respectively.

\section{Case study: Colorado}\label{sec:colorado}


CRS~1-7-515 requires Colorado to conduct risk-limiting audits beginning in 2017.
%(There are provisions to allow the Secretary of State to exempt some counties.)
The first set of coordinated risk-limiting election audits across the state took place in Colorado in November, 2017.\footnote{%
 See \url{https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/RLA/2017RLABackground.html}
}
Those audits only covered contests restricted to a single county:
counties could audit independently.
Colorado's ``uniform voting system'' program\footnote{%
  \url{https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VotingSystems/UniformVotingSystem.html}
} 
led many Colorado counties to purchase (or to plan to purchase) voting systems
that export CVRs, and thus can be audited using ballot-level comparisons.
It is estimated that by June, 2018, 98.2\% of active Colorado voters will be in CVR counties.
These counties cannot audit ballots independently:
margins and risk limits apply to entire contests, not to the portion of a contest included in a county.
To audit statewide elections and contests that cross county lines, Colorado will need to implement new approaches
that account for heterogeneous voting equipment.


Of the methods in Section~\ref{sec:combiningMethods} that Colorado might use to audit cross-jurisdictional contests
that include CVR counties and no-CVR counties,
stratified ``hybrid'' audits seem the most palatable,
given the constraints on time for software development and the logistics
of the audit itself. 
The workflow for counties would be the same
as it was in November, 2017.
Simulations suggest that this approach is relatively efficient.


\subsection{Software and examples}
Examples of stratified hybrid audits, like what could be used in Colorado, are in Jupyter notebooks available
at \url{https://www.github.com/pbstark/CORLA18}.

The first example, in \texttt{hybrid-audit-example-1}, is a hypothetical medium-sized election with 
$110,000$ ballots cast, of which 
9.1\% were cast in no-CVR counties. 
The diluted margin is $1.8\%$.
In 95 of 100 simulations, a stratified ``hybrid'' audit at risk limit 10\% with sample sizes of 500 ballots 
in the CVR stratum and 700 ballots in the no-CVR stratum
(1,200 ballots in all)
would have sufficed to confirm the outcome, if the reported results were correct.

In contrast, an unstratified ballot-level comparison audit with risk limit 10\% could have terminated
after examining 263~ballots if it found no errors, and a ballot-polling audit of the entire contest 
would have been expected to examine about 14,000 ballots, more than 10\% of ballots cast.
The hybrid audit is thus not as efficient as a ballot-level comparison audit, but far more efficient than
a ballot-polling audit.

Another conservative method, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:two-vote-over},
involves conducting a ballot-level comparison audit statewide,
treating any ballot selected from the no-CVR county as if it had a two-vote overstatement.
In this numerical example, that method would lead to a full hand count.

The second example, also in \texttt{hybrid-audit-example-1}, 
is a hypothetical large statewide election with 
2~million ballots cast, of which 5\% were cast in no-CVR counties.
The contest has a diluted margin of nearly $20\%$ and the risk limit is 5\%.
The workload for a hybrid stratified audit is quite low:
In 98\% of 10,000 simulations, auditing 43 ballots from the 
CVR stratum and 20 ballots from the no-CVR stratum
would have sufficed to confirm the outcome at a 5\% risk limit.

If it were possible to conduct a ballot-level comparison audit for the entire contest, 
an audit at risk limit 5\% could terminate after examining 31~ballots if it found no errors.
The additional work needed to do the hybrid stratified audit falls mainly in the no-CVR stratum.

A second notebook, \texttt{hybrid-audit-example-2}, illustrates the 
workflow for conducting a hybrid stratified audit of an election with 2~million ballots cast.
The reported margin is just over $1\%$, but the reported winner
and reported loser are actually tied in both strata.  
The risk limit is 5\%.
We use Fisher's method to combine the audits in the CVR stratum (sample size 500) 
and no-CVR stratum (sample size 1000).
The maximum Fisher's combined $P$-value is over 20\%, so the audit cannot stop at that point.



\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

\comment{to do! this needs to get fleshed out}
We have developed a general procedure for auditing stratified random samples.

These notebooks can be modified and run with different contest sizes, margins, and risk limits to
estimate the workload in different scenarios.

The statistical constraints on the two sample sizes are weak: increasing the
sample size in one stratum generally allows the other sample size to be decreased.
Allocating the sample across the two strata is therefore largely a political decision,
as discussed in section~\ref{sec:crude}.
In general, when the contest outcome is correct, the total workload will be minimized by 
assigning a disproportionately large (compared to the number of ballots cast) amount of 
the work to the CVR stratum.
The software described below can test the implications of different sampling allocations
on the workload in each stratum and the total workload.
