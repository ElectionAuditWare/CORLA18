\begin{abstract}
Colorado CRS~1-7-515 requires risk-limiting tabulation audits (RLAs) starting in 2017.
Most Colorado counties (comprising 98.2\% of voters) have voting equipment amenable to ballot-level comparison audits, but some
are only able to perform ballot-polling audits. 
Combining ballot-polling and ballot-level comparison audits to audit cross-jurisdictional contests was an unsolved problem.
Moreover, Colorado's current audit software (RLATool) does not support audits of cross-jurisdictional contests, even contests entirely
contained in counties that can conduct ballot-level comparison audits. \\

This paper addresses both gaps, along the way introducing a simple, efficient method to use stratified sampling in RLAs.
(Stratification makes it easier to combine ballot-polling and ballot-level comparisons, and also useful to reduce the
required level of coordination among jurisdictions to audit cross-jurisdictional contests.)
We present simple but inefficient methods, more efficient methods
that combine ballot polling and ballot-level comparisons using stratified samples,
and methods that combine ballot-level comparison and
variable-size batch comparison audits without stratification,
noting the changes to RLATool that each of these methods would require.\\

We provide open-source reference implementations of the preferred methods in Jupyter notebooks.

\section{Introduction}
A risk-limiting audit (RLA) of an election is a procedure that
has a known, pre-specified minimum chance of correcting the electoral outcome if the outcome
is incorrect---that is, if the reported outcome differs from the outcome that a full manual
tabulation of the votes would find. 
RLAs require a durable, voter-verifiable record of voter intent, such as paper ballots,
and they assume that this audit trail is sufficiently complete and accurate that a full hand
tally would show the true electoral outcome.
That assumption is not automatically satisfied: a \emph{compliance audit}
\cite{starkWagner12} 
is required.

Risk-limiting audits are generally (but not necessarily) incremental: they examine more ballots, or batches of ballots,
until either (i)~there is strong statistical evidence that a full hand tabulation would confirm the outcome,
or (ii)~the audit has led to a full hand tabulation, the result of which should become the official
result.

RLAs have been piloted in California, Colorado, and Ohio, and a test of
RLA procedures has been conducted in Arizona.
RLA bills are being drafted or are already under consideration in California,
Virginia, Washington, and other states.
A number of laws have either allowed or mandated risk-limiting audits,
including California AB~2023 (Salda\~{n}a), SB~360 (Padilla), and AB~44 (Mullin);
Rhode Island SB~413A and HB~5704A; and Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS)~1-7-515.
At the time of writing, California is considering another RLA bill, AB~2125.

CRS~1-7-515 requires 
Colorado to conduct risk-limiting audits beginning in 2017.
(There are provisions to allow the Secretary of State to exempt some counties.)
The first set of coordinated risk-limiting election audits across the state took place in Colorado in November, 2017.\footnote{%
 See \url{https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/RLA/2017RLABackground.html}
}
Those audits only covered contests restricted to a single county,
so counties could conduct audits independently.
To audit statewide elections and contests that cross county lines, Colorado will need to implement new approaches
and modify their auditing software, RLATool (\url{https://github.com/FreeAndFair/ColoradoRLA/}).

Colorado's ``uniform voting system'' program\footnote{%
\url{https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VotingSystems/UniformVotingSystem.html}
} led
many Colorado counties to purchase (or to plan to purchase) voting systems
that are auditable at the ballot level: those systems export cast vote records (CVRs)
for individual ballots in a manner that allows the corresponding paper ballot to be identified,
and conversely, make it possible to find the CVR corresponding to any
particular paper ballot.
We call counties that have such systems ``CVR'' counties.
It is estimated that by June, 2018, 98.2\% of active Colorado voters will be in CVR counties.
CVR counties can perform ``ballot-level comparison audits,'' \cite{lindemanStark12} 
which are currently the
most efficient approach to risk-limiting audits in that they require examining
fewer ballots than other methods do, when the outcome of the contest under audit 
is in fact correct.

Voting systems in other counties (``legacy'' or ``no-CVR'' counties) 
do not allow auditors to check how the system
interpreted voter intent for individual ballots.
The election results can still be audited, provided the voting systems
create a voter-verifiable paper trail (\emph{e.g.}, voter-marked paper ballots) that is
conserved to ensure that it remains accurate and intact, and organized well enough
to permit ballots to be selected at random.
Pilot audits in California suggest that the most efficient way to audit such systems
is by ``ballot-polling'' \cite{lindemanEtal12,lindemanStark12} 
(in contrast to ``batch-level comparisons,'' for example).

There is currently no literature on how to perform risk-limiting audits 
of contests that include CVR counties and no-CVR counties by combining
ballot polling and ballot-level comparisons.
Existing methods would either require all counties to use the lowest
common denominator, ballot-polling (which does not take advantage of the CVRs,
and thus is expected to require more auditing than a method that does take
advantage of the CVRs), or would
require no-CVR counties to perform batch-level comparisons, which were found in
California to be (generally) less efficient than ballot-polling audits.%
\footnote{%
  See~\cite{Rivest-2018-bayesian-tabulation-audits}
  for a different (Bayesian) approach to auditing contests that include both CVR counties
  and no-CVR counties. Bayesian audits are not, in general, risk-limiting.
  }

The open-source audit software used for Colorado's 2017 audits,
RLATool (\url{https://github.com/FreeAndFair/ColoradoRLA/}),
needs additional features to be able to audit
contests that cross county lines and to audit small contests efficiently.

First, the current version (1.1.0) of RLATool
needs to be modified to recognize and group together contests that cross jurisdictional
boundaries; currently, it treats every contest as if it were entirely
contained in a single county.
% Margins and risk limits apply to entire contests, not to the portion of a contest included in a county.
RLATool also does not allow the user to select the sample size, nor does
it directly allow an unstratified random sample to be drawn across counties.

Second, to audit a contest that includes votes in no-CVR counties
and votes in CVR counties, new statistical methods are needed to
preserve the efficiency of ballot-level comparison audits in CVR counties.

Third, contests that appear only on a subset of ballots can
be audited much more efficiently if the sample can be drawn from just those ballots
that contain the contest.
While allowing samples to be restricted to ballots reported\footnote{%
 There are methods for conducting RLAs that account for the possibility that the reported ballot style is incorrect;
 see~\cite{banuelosStark12}.
} or known to contain a particular
contest is not essential in the short run, it will be necessary
eventually to make it affordable to audit smaller contests.

We focus on near-term requirements for risk-limiting audits in Colorado, incidentally
developing a new method for using stratified samples in RLAs that is widely applicable.
Section~\ref{sec:crude} presents crude but inefficient approaches
that could be implemented easily.
Section~\ref{sec:variable}
presents an approach based on comparison audits with different batch sizes.
This approach is statistically simple and relatively efficient, but might require changing how counties
handle their ballots.
Section~\ref{sec:hybrid} presents our recommended approach, which combines ballot-level
comparisons in counties that can perform them with ballot-polling in the no-CVR counties.
% This approach is generalizable to other stratified audits, where ballots are divided into disjoint
% ``strata,'' sampled independently; the results are combined using Fisher's method to produce an audit of the
% overall contest.
All the approaches require new software, including some changes to RLATool.
We provide example software implementing the risk calculations for
our recommended approach as a Python Jupyter notebook.\footnote{%
 See \url{https://github.com/pbstark/CORLA18}.
}
Section~\ref{sec:subcollections}
describes how audit efficiency could be improved in CVR counties by combining CVR
data with data from Colorado's voter registration system, SCORE.\footnote{%
  SCORE is Colorado's voter registration system, which also tracks who voted.
  See \url{https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/SCORE/SCOREhome.html}.
  SCORE essentially keeps track of how many ballots of each style were returned by voters,
  information that can be used to check whether the voting system tabulated the correct number
  of ballots in each contest.
} 
Sections~\ref{sec:comparisonError} and~\ref{sec:ballotPollError} explain the recommended
modifications to ballot-level comparison and ballot-polling audits, respectively. 
Section~\ref{sec:recommendations} summarizes our recommendations and
considerations for implementation.

%\subsection{Priorities for Colorado}
%\note{for this particular paper focused on stratification, is the order of paragraphs here right?}
%Auditing efficiency is controlled in part by how well the audit can limit the sample to ballots that
%contain the contests under audit.
%Some contests are on (essentially) every ballot, for instance the governor's race.
%Others, such as mayoral contests, may appear on only a small fraction of ballots cast in
%a county.
%Partisan primaries---even for statewide office---are somewhere in between,
%because in general no single party's primary appears on every ballot cast in the state.
%Thus, either we reduce efficiency for the sake of simplicity by continuing to sample ballots uniformly within 
%counties (or collections of counties), or we develop a way to
%focus the auditing on the ballots that contain the contest.
%The latter requires external information, e.g., from SCORE,
%as discussed below.
%
%Moreover, party primaries for statewide offices (and perhaps other contests) will
%include CVR counties and no-CVR counties, so we need a method to audit
%across both kinds of voting technology. 
%
%This report addresses both issues, providing options for effectively auditing heterogeneous 
%voting technology, varying in efficiency, complexity, and on whom any additional audit burden falls.

\section{Preliminary notation}
Here and generally throughout the paper, we 
discuss auditing a single plurality contest at a time, although the same sample can be used to audit
more than one contest (and super-majority contests), and there are ways of combining audits of different contests into
a single process \cite{stark09c,stark10d}.
We use terminology drawn from a number of papers; the key reference is Lindeman and Stark, 2012~\cite{lindemanStark12}.
An \emph{overstatement error} is an error that caused the margin between \emph{any} reported
winner and \emph{any} reported loser to appear larger than it really was.
An \emph{understatement error} is an error that caused the margin between \emph{every} reported
winner and \emph{every} reported loser to appear to be smaller than it really was.

Throughout, we will refer to a contest between reported winner $w$ and reported loser $\ell$.
The total number of reported votes for candidate~$w$ is denoted $V_w$ 
and the total for candidate~$\ell$ is denoted $V_\ell$, so that $V_w > V_\ell$, since 
$w$ is the reported winner.

We introduce additional notation below, as needed.

\section{Simple approaches} \label{sec:crude}

\subsection{Hand count the legacy counties}
The simplest approach to combining legacy counties with CVR counties is to require every
legacy county to do a full hand count, and to conduct a 
ballot-level comparison audit in CVR counties, based on contest margins adjusted for
the results of the manual tallies in the CVR counties.
For instance, imagine a contest with two candidates, reported winner $w$ and reported loser $\ell$.
Suppose that a full manual tally of the votes in the legacy counties shows $V_w'$ votes for $w$ and
$V_\ell'$ votes for $\ell$.
Suppose that a total of $N$ ballots were cast in the CVR counties.
Then the \emph{diluted margin}  for the comparison audit in the CVR counties is defined to be
$[(V_w-V_w')-(V_\ell-V_\ell')]/N$.
Requiring a full hand count in the legacy counties has obvious disadvantages, except perhaps in very 
close contests where ballot polling is not efficient. (But it does have the advantage of not forcing CVR 
counties to do additional auditing to compensate for the legacy counties.)

\subsection{Subtract error bounds for the legacy counties from vote totals}
If ballot accounting and SCORE data can provide good upper bounds on the number of ballots cast in
each contest in legacy counties, there are simple upper bounds on the total
possible overstatement error each legacy county could contribute to the overall contest
results; those can be subtracted from the overall margin (as in the previous subsection) and the
remainder of the contests can be audited in CVR counties against the adjusted margins.
For instance, consider a contest that appears on $N$ ballots in a legacy counties.
Suppose that in legacy counties, the overall, statewide contest winner, $w$, is reported to have received $V_w'$ votes, and some loser, $\ell$, is reported to have received $V_\ell'$ votes. 
(Note that $V_\ell'$ could be greater than $V_w'$: $w$ is not necessarily the reported winner in the legacy counties.)
Then the most overstatement error that the county could possibly have in determining whether
$w$ in fact beat $\ell$ is if every reported undervote, invalid vote, or vote for a different candidate, $t$, had 
in fact been a vote for $\ell$ (producing a 1-vote overstatement), and every vote reported for 
$w$ was in fact a vote for $\ell$ (producing a 2-vote overstatement).
The reduction in the margin that would produce is 
$N - V_w' - V_\ell' + 2V_w' = N + V_w' - V_\ell'$ votes.

Whereas the previous approach places the auditing burden created by obsolescent equipment entirely on 
the legacy counties, this approach places it entirely upon the CVR counties. In a close contest, it 
could require a full hand count in every county.

\subsection{Treat legacy counties as if every ballot selected from them for audit has a two-vote overstatement}\label{sec:two-vote-over}
A third simple-but-pessimistic approach is to sample uniformly from all counties as if one
were performing a ballot-level comparison audit everywhere,  but to 
treat any ballot
selected from a legacy county as a two-vote overstatement. This approach has the same disadvantages
as the previous approach.

\section{Variable batch sizes} \label{sec:variable}

Another approach is to perform a comparison audit across all counties, but to use batches consisting
of more than one ballot (batch-level comparisons)
in legacy counties and batches consisting of a single ballot (ballot-level comparisons) in CVR counties.\footnote{%
 For majority and plurality elections, including those in which voters can select more than one candidate,
  audits can be based on overstatement and understatement errors at the level of batches.
}
This requires that the no-CVR counties report vote subtotals
for physically identifiable batches.
If a county's voting system can only report subtotals by precinct but 
the county does not sort paper ballots by
precinct, this approach might require revising how the county handles its
paper; we understand that this is the case in many Colorado counties.

That said, many California counties that do not sort vote-by-mail (VBM)
ballots by precinct conduct the statutory 1\% audits by manually retrieving the ballots 
for just those precincts selected for audit from whatever physical batches they happen to be in: 
the situation is identical to that in Colorado.

Another solution is the ``Boulder-style'' batch-level audit,\footnote{%
 See \url{http://bcn.boulder.co.us/~neal/elections/boulder-audit-10-11/}.
}
which requires generating 
vote subtotals after each physical batch is scanned, and exporting those subtotals in machine-readable form.
That in turn may require using extra memory cards, repeatedly initializing and deleting tabulation databases,
or other measures that add complexity and opportunity for error.

While those two approaches are laborious, they would provide a viable short-term solution,
especially combined with information from SCORE to check that the reported batch-level results contain the correct number of ballots for each contest under audit.
Moreover, it does not unduly increase the workload in CVR counties
to compensate for legacy equipment.

Variable-batch-size comparison audits would require modifying or augmenting
RLATool in several ways: 

\begin{enumerate}

  \item The CVR reporting tool would need to be modified to allow no-CVR counties to
report batch-level results in a manner analogous to how CVR counties report
ballot-level results, or an external tool would need to be provided.

  \item The sampling
algorithm would have to allow sampling batches---and sampling them with unequal probability,
because efficient batch-level audits involve sampling batches with probability proportional
to a bound on the possible overstatement error in the batch.
It would also need to calculate the appropriate sampling probability for each batch (of whatever size).
Again, this could be accommodated using an external tool to draw the sample from legacy counties.

  \item The risk calculations would need to be modified. 
This, too, could be done with external software, with suitable provisions for capturing audit data
from RLATool or directly from legacy counties.
\end{enumerate}

None of these changes is enormous; the mathematics and statistics are already worked out
in published papers \textbf{\textcolor{red}{PROVIDE CITES}}, and there is exemplar code for calculating the
batch-level error bounds, drawing the samples with probability proportional to an
error bound, and calculating the attained risk from the sample results.
Indeed, this is the method that was used in several of California's pilot audits,
including the audit in Orange County.
A derivation of a method for comparison audits with variable batch sizes is given below
in section~\ref{sec:comparisonError}.

\section{Stratified ``hybrid'' audits} \label{sec:hybrid}

Other approaches involve \emph{stratification}: partitioning the cast ballots
into non-overlapping groups and sampling independently from those groups.
One could stratify by county, but in general it is simpler and more efficient
statistically (i.e., results in auditing fewer ballots) to minimize the number of strata.
We consider methods that use two strata: CVR counties and no-CVR counties. 
Collectively, the ballots cast in CVR counties comprise one stratum and the ballots cast in 
legacy counties comprise a second stratum; every ballot cast in the contest is in 
exactly one of the two strata. 
We assume that the samples are drawn from the
two strata independently.

Incidentally, the stratified method we present is applicable to other stratified audits, 
 not just those with one stratum comprised of CVR counties 
 and another stratum comprised of no-CVR counties.

\subsection{Partitioning the total permissible overstatement into strata}
The simplest approach to stratification involves partitioning the risk limit and the tolerable
overstatement error of the tabulation into
two pieces, one for the (pooled) CVR counties and one for the (pooled) no-CVR counties.
Let $V_{w\ell} > 0$ denote the contest-wide margin (in votes) of reported winner 
$w$ over reported loser
$\ell$.
Let $V_{w\ell,s}$ denote the margin (in votes) of reported winner $w$ over reported loser $\ell$
in stratum $s$. 
Note that $V_{w\ell,s}$ might be negative in one stratum.
Let $A_{w\ell}$ denote the margin (in votes)
of reported winner $w$ over reported loser $\ell$ that 
a full hand count of the entire contest would show, that is, the \emph{actual} margin rather
than the \emph{reported} margin.
Reported winner $w$ really beat reported loser $\ell$ if and only if $A_{w\ell} > 0$.
Define $A_{w\ell,s}$ to be the actual margin (in votes) of $w$ over $\ell$ in stratum $s$;
this too may be negative.

Let $\omega_{w\ell,s} \equiv V_{w\ell,s} - A_{w\ell,s}$ be the \emph{overstatement}
of the margin of $w$ over $\ell$ in stratum $s$.
Reported winner $w$ really beat reported loser 
$\ell$ if and only if $\omega_{w\ell} \equiv \omega_{w\ell,1} + \omega_{w\ell,2} < V_{w\ell}$.

Pick $\lambda_1 \in \Re$ and define $\lambda_2 = 1-\lambda_1$. 
These values can be used to partition the
total tolerable overstatement between the two strata:
If $\omega_{w\ell,1} < \lambda_1 V_{w\ell}$ \emph{and} 
$\omega_{w\ell,2} < \lambda_2 V_{w\ell}$, candidate $w$ really received more votes
than candidate $\ell$.
This condition is sufficient, but not necessary, to confirm that $\omega_{w\ell,1} + \omega_{w\ell,2} < V_{w\ell}$.
Some $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$ pairs 
can be ruled out \emph{a priori}, because (for instance) $\omega_{w\ell,s} \in [-2N_s, 2N_s]$,
where $N_s$ is the number of ballots cast in stratum $s$.

For ballot-level comparison audits, auditing to ensure that $\omega_{w\ell,s} < \lambda_s V_{w\ell}$
is discussed in section~\ref{sec:comparisonError}.  It is a minor modification of the method
embodied in RLATool.

For ballot-polling audits, auditing to ensure that $\omega_{w\ell,s} < \lambda_s V_{w\ell}$ is discussed in section~\ref{sec:ballotPollError}.
Note that this requires a more substantial modification of the standard ballot-polling calculations,
because the standard calculations consider only the fraction of ballots with a vote for either 
$w$ or $\ell$ that contain a vote for $w$, while we need to make an inference about the 
difference between the number of votes for $w$ and the number of votes for $\ell$.
This introduces an additional unknown nuisance parameter, the number of ballots with votes for either
$w$ or $\ell$.

\section{Recommendations} \label{sec:recommendations}

We have outlined several methods Colorado might use to audit cross-jurisdictional contests
that include CVR counties and no-CVR counties.
We expect that stratified ``hybrid'' audits will be the most palatable,
given the constraints on time for software development and the logistics
of the audit itself, because the workflow for counties would be the same
as it was in November, 2017.
Additionally, we expect that using this approach would tend to minimize the workload, compared to the other methods.

What would change is the risk calculation ``behind the scene,'' including the
algorithms used to decide when the audit can stop.
Those algorithms could be implemented in software external to RLATool.
The minimal modification to RLATool that would be required to conduct
a hybrid audit is to allow the sample size from each county to be controlled externally,
e.g. by uploading a parameter file once per round,
rather than using a formula that is based on the margin within that county alone.
The parameter file would be generated by external software that does the
audit calculations described here based on the detailed
audit progress and discrepancy data available from RLATools' rla\_export command.


\subsection{Software and examples}
Examples of stratified hybrid audits are in Jupyter notebooks available
at \url{https://www.github.com/pbstark/CORLA18}.
The first two examples are contained in a single notebook, ``hybrid-audit-example-1''.
The first example is a hypothetical medium-sized election with a total of 
$110,000$ votes and a diluted margin of $1.8\%$.
9.1\% of the ballots come from no-CVR counties. The risk limit is 10\%.
In 93 of 100 simulations, a stratified ``hybrid'' audit with samples of 400 ballots in the CVR stratum and 600 ballots in the no-CVR stratum
and risk limit 10\% would have sufficed to confirm that the total overstatement error did not exceed the overall margin.
This combined method would require a total of 1,000 ballots to be examined.

If a CVR were available for all counties and we could have run a ballot-level comparison audit for the entire contest, 
rather than stratifying, an audit with risk limit 10\% that found no errors would have concluded after examining just 263 ballots.
The efficiency gained comes from two sources.
First, ballot-level comparison audits are substantially more efficient than ballot-polling audits.
If no CVR were available in any county and we had run a ballot-polling audit for the entire contest,
the expected sample size needed to confirm the audit with a risk limit of 10\% would have been 13,988.
The ballot-polling audit would require checking over 10\% of ballots cast, an infeasible number in practice.
Second, the hybrid audit divides the margin and risk limit between two strata under the hood.
To attain a Fisher's combined $p$-value less than the risk limit,
only one stratum-level risk needs to be small;
the risk in the other stratum may be large.
For instance, if the stratum-level risks were $90\%$ and $2\%$,
then the Fisher's combined $p$-value would be less than 10\%,
but if the stratum-level risks were $45\%$ and $5\%$, it would not.
Sample sizes must be increased to ensure that 
one or both of the stratum-level risks is small enough.
The workload is more than a pure ballot-comparison audit, but substantially less than a pure ballot-polling audit.

Another method discussed in Section~\ref{sec:two-vote-over} is to perform a ballot-level comparison audit statewide,
but to treat any ballot sampled from the no-CVR county as showing a two-vote overstatement.
In this example, this worst-case method would lead to a full hand count.
However, the situation may be more optimistic for Colorado:
if only 1.2\% of ballots came from the no-CVR stratum and the overall margin were in fact 10,000 votes,
then this method would require checking 430 ballots.

The second example is a hypothetical large statewide election with a total of 
2~million ballots and a diluted margin of nearly $20\%$.  The risk limit is 5\%.
If a CVR were available for all counties and we could have run a ballot-level comparison audit for the entire contest, 
rather than stratifying, an audit with risk limit 5\% that found no errors would have concluded after examining just 31 ballots.
Using Fisher's method to conduct a hybrid audit does not increase the workload substantially:
In 100\% of 10,000 simulations, an audit with samples of 50 ballots in the CVR stratum and 20 ballots in the no-CVR stratum
would have sufficed to confirm that the total overstatement error did not exceed the overall margin at the 5\% risk limit.

A second notebook, ``hybrid-audit-example-2,'' illustrates the workflow for conducting a hybrid audit of this kind.
The example election has a total of 2~million ballots.
The reported margin is just over $1\%$, but in reality the vote totals for the reported winner
and reported loser are identical in both strata.  The risk limit is 5\%.
We use Fisher's method to combine the audits in the CVR stratum and no-CVR stratum.
The sample sizes in each stratum are large, but the maximum Fisher's combined $p$-value is over 20\%,
so the audit cannot be terminated.
In each case, the audit leads to a full recount of all the ballots.

These notebooks can be modified and run with different contest sizes, margins, and risk limits, in order to
estimate the workload of different scenarios.
